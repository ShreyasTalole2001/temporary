                        Farmers from Agrarian distressed area are polarised among various factors like catastrophes of
                        climate change, exploitation in the Agro-Marketing process and apathetic approach of government.
                        Krishi Vikas, a non for profit organisation founded by Mr. Dilip Naphade from Buldhana has been
                        striving to cater services to address some of the issues since 1991. Considering their
                        consistence
                        breathless efforts SFAC, New Delhi appointed this organisation to promote Farmers Producer’s
                        Company. Vidarbha- a part of Maharashtra, being prevalently drought prone has been deprived of
                        equal
                        opportunities in the process of Maharashtra’s development. Krushi Vikas (Resource Institution)
                        collected the basic demographic and technical data to understand the needs, magnitude of the
                        issue
                        and available resources for interventions etc.
