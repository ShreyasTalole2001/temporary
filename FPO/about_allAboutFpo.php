            <span style="font-weight: 700;">All About FPO is an initiative of Krushi Vikas Va Gramin Prashikshan Sanstha</span> <br>
            <br>
            Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can be constituted by the Primary Producers like Farmers (Landed as
            well as Landless), Artisans, Milk Producers, Honey Cultivators, Silk Cultivators etc There are around 8000
            FPOs legally established in India, but not many of them are currently operational. Many of these FPOs failed
            to perform well due to lack of technical knowledge and Business Orientation and overall unavailability of
            facilitators. <br>
            <br>
            Indian Government, in 2020 launched 10000 FPO Program and declared its intention to aggressively
            establish FPOs throughout the country within next 3-4 years. Realizing the need of handholding and
            facilitation for FPOs, various organizations have been empaneled as CBBO - Community Based Business
            Organization who will promote FPOs within their allocated regions. Krushi Vikas Va Gramin Prashikshan
            Sanstha (Krushi Vikas) has been empaneled as a CBBO with NABARD, SFAC, NAFED as well as NCDC and
            currently working for constitution of 70 FPOs. It is the prominent organization in central India and a rare
            CBBO which has been empaneled with all these four Institutions. <br>
            <br>
            With an intension to share our experience and acquired knowledge with other CBBOs as well as FPOs, we
            have created this platform - ALL ABOUT FPO. This platform is open to all the stakeholders of agribusiness
            and allied sectors including but not limited to Farmers, FPO Members, Entrepreneurs, CBBOs, Students of
            Development Science, Bankers, Government Depts, Corporates, Retailers. Through this platform, we wish to
            create a symbiotic association among all these stakeholders whereby there would be no barriers to
            information as well as commodities to transfer across boundaries of our specific regions.<br>
            <br>
            We are committed to share and transfer its acquired knowledge gained over the years in FPO formation,
            nurturing, promotion and management. We aim to do this through a dedicated entity ‘FPO Chamber of
            Commerce- All About FPO’ that shall provide 360 degree support to all the stakeholders on all aspects of
            effective formation, nurturing, and management of FPOs. For this we have adopted a four-pronged
            approach.<br>
